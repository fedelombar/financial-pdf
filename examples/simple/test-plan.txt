# Financial Reports Package - Test Plan

## Current Status
- Chart functions are working correctly (demonstrated in simple-test.ts)
- PDF export has compatibility issues with jsPDF library

## Test Plan Steps

### 1. Module Tests
- ✅ Chart generation (bar, line, pie charts) - PASSED
- ❌ PDF export - FAILED due to jsPDF compatibility issues
- ⬜ CSV export - Not tested yet
- ⬜ Excel export - Not tested yet
- ⬜ Bank reconciliation - Not tested yet

### 2. Integration Tests
- ⬜ Report generation with multiple sections
- ⬜ Exporting complete reports to different formats

### 3. Next.js Integration
- ⬜ Create React components that use the charts
- ⬜ Test server-side rendering compatibility
- ⬜ Test client-side chart rendering

## Fixing jsPDF Issues

The primary issue is with the jsPDF library and its TypeScript declarations. To fix this:

1. Install latest jsPDF version with proper types:
   ```
   npm uninstall jspdf
   npm install jspdf@latest @types/jspdf@latest
   ```

2. If still having issues, modify PDF exporter to use a different approach:
   - Consider using html-pdf or puppeteer instead
   - Create an HTML template and convert it to PDF
   - Use canvas-based approach for charts

3. For testing without PDF export:
   - Continue using the simple-test.ts approach
   - Create in-memory reports for testing
   - Test individual components separately

## Once PDF Issues Are Fixed

1. Create unit tests for each module
2. Create integration tests for the full package
3. Create a sample Next.js app demonstrating integration
4. Document the API and usage examples
